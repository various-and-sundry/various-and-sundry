      <h2>Operating System and Hardware</h2>
      <h3>Operating System</h3>
      <p>I am now using Arch Linux. I previously used a base install of Debian on which I installed i3, but since I was already customizing many things, moving to a distribution that is designed for a customized installation, such as Arch, made sense. Also, Arch's packages are generally much more up-to-date than Debian's packages, and the fact that it is a rolling release distribution allows me to use the system indefinitely with out a full reinstall.</p>
      <p>Arch is known for being difficult to install and maintain. Its updates are also known for breaking things. Consequently, I was concerned that it might not be practical. However, it was much easier to install than I expected. In fact, despite never having installed it before, I was able to install it faster than I normally install Debian (mostly because the Wi-Fi drivers were pre-installed). I was also under the impression that I would have to compile the kernel, but that was not the case. Its installation was far simpler than I expected.</p>
      <p>Additionally, despite the reputation of Arch's updates, I have never installed an update that broke anything major. Occasionally, I have experienced an update that had minor mistakes, such as miss-coloring a button, but those are rare and relatively inconsequential. In general, I have found Arch to be reliable.</p>
