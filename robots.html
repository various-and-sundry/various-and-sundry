      <p class="centext">Here are a few robotic projects. They are somewhat unrefined, but their designs are available here anyway. They all currently require 3D printing.

         <h2>V.O.R.P. - Version One Robotic Platform</h2>
         <img src="images/vorp/vorpgreenbackground.jpg" alt="" class="centimage">
         <p class="centext">V.O.R.P is a mobile and almost fully 3D printed prototype robot. It can drive, move its arms and head, sense distance, beep, and fall apart. There are many flaws with its design, but because it looks nice and is the first fully 3D printed robot I built, it is one of my favorite robots.

      <h1>WowWee Robots!</h1>
      <p class="centext">WowWee Robotics has created many of the most popular toy robots. Most of their current products are not as large and "hackable" as their discontinued robots, but most of them can still be found on eBay for a fair price. I thought it would be worth sharing some information regarding some of their products, most notably, their raw IR codes.
