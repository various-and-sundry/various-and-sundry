      <h1>3D Printed Robots!</h1>
      <p class="centext">Here are a few robotic projects. They are somewhat unrefined, but their designs are available here anyway. They all currently require 3D printing.

         <h2>V.O.R.P. - Version One Robotic Platform</h2>
         <img src="images/vorp/vorp_0145.jpg" alt="" class="centimage">
         <p class="centext">V.O.R.P is a mobile and almost fully 3D printed prototype robot. It can drive, move its arms and head, sense distance, beep, and fall apart. There are many flaws with its design, but because it looks nice and is the first fully 3D printed robot I built, it is one of my favorite robots.

      <h1>WowWee Robots!</h1>
      <p class="centext">WowWee Robotics is a toy company that has released many popular toy robots. Many of their current robots are not as large and "hackable" as some of their previous products, but most of their older products can still be found on eBay for a fair price. I thought it would be worth sharing some information regarding some of their products, most notably their raw IR codes.
