      <p>During the 80s and 90s, a number of technology manufacturers produced hand-held PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) devices. CASIO made a number of them, including Credit Card form-factor PDAs. They could generally function as calculators, alarms, clocks, contact books, etc. These types of devices were later replaced with larger, touchscreen PDAs that are often called "Smart Phones."</p>
      <p>One of these Credit Card form-factor PDAs was the <a href="http://casio-pda.wikidot.com/dc-810">CASIO DC-810</a>. Released in 1988, it could function as a schedule, telephone book, alarm, and calculator. It originally came in a protective sleeve, but perhaps a 3D printed case would be better.</p>
